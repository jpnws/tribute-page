            <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> was a German-born theoretical
            physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two
            pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is
            also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is
            best known to the general public for his mass-energy equivalence
            formula E=mc<sup>2</sup>, which has been dubbed "the world's most
            famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for
            his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his
            discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in
            the development of quantum theory.
          </p>
          <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in
            the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents were Hermann
            Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the
            family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob
            founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that
            manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.
          </p>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            The Einsteins were non-observant Ashkenazi Jews, and Albert attended
            a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of 5, for three
            years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium
            (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received
            advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the
            German Empire seven years later.

          <h2>Manhattan Project</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré
            physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi
            atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted. Einstein
            and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and
            Eugene Wigner, "regarded it as their responsibility to alert
            Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the
            race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more
            than willing to resort to such a weapon."
          </p>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few
            months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and
            Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs,
            which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was
            asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to
            President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in
            its own nuclear weapons research.
          </p>
          <h2>Special Relativity</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            Einstein's "Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper" ("On the
            Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies") was received on 30 June 1905 and
            published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts
            between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism)
            and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the
            laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of these changes are
            most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds
            close to the speed of light). The theory developed in this paper
            later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a
            relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would
            appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its
            direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a
            luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in
            physics at the time—was superfluous.
          </p>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            In his paper on mass-energy equivalence, Einstein produced E =
            mc<sup>2</sup>
            as a consequence of his special relativity equations. Einstein's
            1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but
            was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.
          </p>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics
            (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski
            reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of
            spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915
            general theory of relativity.
          </p>
          <h2>Quantum Mechanics</h2>
          <p class="main-paragraph">
            Einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning
            with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became
            displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after
            1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical
            that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than
            the result of determinism, stating that God "is not playing at
            dice". Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that
            quantum mechanics was incomplete.
